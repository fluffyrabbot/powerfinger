# R30-OLED-NONE-NONE KiCad Skeleton

This directory is the PCB/schematic starting point for the active optical ring
lane. It is intentionally honest about its state: there is no finished KiCad
project here yet, only the inputs and layout constraints that should drive the
first capture.

## Current Source Files

- `r30_oled_none_none.kicad_sch` — root sheet for the active optical ring lane
- `sheets/power_and_charge.kicad_sch`
- `sheets/mcu_radio.kicad_sch`
- `sheets/sensor_and_click.kicad_sch`
- `sheets/usb_and_service.kicad_sch`

## What Belongs Here Next

- `r30_oled_none_none.kicad_pcb`
- Local symbol and footprint references only where upstream libraries are not
  enough
- Plot and fabrication presets once routing exists
- `INTERFACE-CONTRACT.md` — first-pass electrical pin contract for capture and firmware
- `CAPTURE-BINDINGS.md` — which active BOM lines need stock, vendor, or custom binding
- `SCHEMATIC-CAPTURE.md` — sheet split, net naming, and capture order
- `BOM-BLOCK-MAP.md` — turn the BOM into schematic blocks without drift
- `RECOMMENDED-FIRST-CAPTURE.md` — the recommended P0 scope boundary

## Capture Order

1. Power tree: protected LiPo, TP4054 charge path, RT9080 LDO, charge-enable
   MOSFET, NTC divider
2. MCU/module block: `ESP32-C3-MINI-1-N4` with antenna keep-out reserved first
3. Sensor block: PAW3204-class optical sensor plus matching lens and aperture
4. Human input block: dome switch and any required debounce/passive support
5. USB-C and programming path for charging plus firmware bring-up

## Hard Constraints

- Treat [PLACEMENT-CONSTRAINTS.md](PLACEMENT-CONSTRAINTS.md) as a blocker list,
  not optional polish.
- Do not substitute the LDO, charge resistor, or battery safety path without
  updating the variant manifest and BOM.
- Do not let convenience routing eat the antenna keep-out.
- Treat the current schematic files as hierarchy scaffolds, not proof that the
  active components or footprints have already been validated in KiCad.
